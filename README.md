This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug: inadequate type checking in a function. The function `foo` is intended to increment a numeric input but doesn't sufficiently handle non-numeric types, leading to an error when a non-numeric value is passed in. The solution showcases the importance of robust type validation for preventing unexpected runtime errors and improving code reliability.  This example highlights the need for thorough input validation in JavaScript.
